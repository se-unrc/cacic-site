  cacic_history: The XXV Argentinian Conference of Computer Science is going to 
    take place for first time in Cordoba Province, during the second week of
    October, at headquarters of Facultad de Ciencias Exactas, Físico-Químicas y
    Naturales of Universidad Nacional de Río Cuarto, Río Cuarto, Córdoba,
    Argentina. CACIC is the national event with greatest participation and more
    federal reaching. It acts as a meeting point for researches, teaches,
    grade/postgrade students and IT practicioners.

  the_conference_description: Argentinean Congress of Computer Science (CACIC)
    is organized by the national universitites network with informatic careers
    (RedUNCI). CACIC gather since 1995 researches, teachers, practicioners and
    students linked with computing disciplines
  the_school_description: The international School of Computing associated with
    CACIC gives intensive courses of training to grade students, posgrade
    students, graduates and researchers, about diverse topics of interest to
    computer science
  the_athenaeum_description: Athenaeum of Universitaries Teachers of computing
    gather teachers and students of superior level, involved in the computer
    discipline, to discuss, analyze and study different apporaches of

  course_description: Course 
  course2_detail: Detailed description of the course (in Spanish)
  course2_prerequisites1: 
    It's important for attendants to have sufficient knowledge on programming, 
    knowledge on programming, as this course is hands-on.
  course2_prerequisites2: 
    Acceptable languages are Smalltalk, Java, C#, Python, Ruby, JavaScript and PHP.
  course2_prerequisites3: 
    The software requirements for taking the course (this is for students' own computers) is simply 
    to have the programming language installed (with a suitable IDE), and a corresponding xUnit framework.
  course3_prerequisites: While it is recommended that attendants are already familiar with basic 
    concepts from probability theory and programming languages, this course 
    will go through all the necessary concepts. It is a self-content course that should 
    be accessible to any Computer Science student.
  course4_prerequisites: >
    Basic knowledge on discrete mathematics and propositional (boolean) logic.
  course2_description: The aim of this course is to convey the main concepts 
    of the software development technique known as  Test Driven Development (TDD), 
    through practical and everyday programming examples. This course starts with a brief 
    theoretical introduction, and then concentrates in practical programming exercises, 
    especially designed so that students can master the technique, as we believe that 
    'the best way to learn is by doing'
  course3_description1:  >
    In the last few years, probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) have 
    received increasing attenting, both from academia and industry. To a great extent, this is 
    due to the way in which these languages have revolutionized artificial intelligence. 
    For instance, modern PPLs can do in 50 lines of code what previously required over 1000.
  course3_description2:  >
    The main objective of this course is to introduce students to the "world" of PPLs, in a broad manner,
    covering both practical aspects and foundations. We will start by discussing the benefits and 
    potential of probabilistic computational models, going through their main applications, 
    putting special emphasis on the cause of this revolution: artificial intelligence and bayesian 
    reasoning. The second part of the course will cover the main challenges in the design and 
    implementation of PPLs. Finally, we will discuss the formal semantics and different 
    verification techniques for probabilistic programs.
  course4_description1:  >
    Propositional logic: definitions and limitations. 
  course4_description2:  >
    Predicate logic: definitions and limitations.
  course4_description3:  >
    Relational logic. 
  course4_description4:  >
    Program specification: weakest precondition, partial and total program correctness. 
  course4_description5:  >
    The Java Modeling Language: a language for program specification.  
  course4_description6:  >
    Automated fault localization. 
  course4_description7:  >
    Automated program repair.

  abstract_athenaeum: En el año 2016, la Iniciativa Program.AR de la Fundación Sadosky diseñó una convocatoria orientada a que Universidades públicas e Institutos de Formación docente se aliaran para diseñar y dictar Especializaciones de formación docente en Didáctica de las Ciencias de la Computación de dos años de duración. Esta fue y sigue siendo la única experiencia en Argentina de formación docente contínua para docentes de todos los niveles educativos en esta materia. En esta charla se presentarán los detalles de la experiencia, resaltando los aprendizajes realizados hasta la fecha por los distintos actores involucrados y las recomendaciones a futuro.

  acco_info: CACIC 2019 is not responsible for hotel reservations. To access the prices mentioned below, you must mention that you attend to CACIC. Due to the city's limited hotel capacity, it is recommended to book with anticipation.
  transport_info: >
    The University of Rio Cuarto is 7 km away from the city center. To arrive there are taxi  and remises companies that can carry out this section (we don't know the prices). In addition, there is a local bus service which covers this route. Local transportation company (SATCRC) has its own card system (SATBUS) with a cost of $ 80 and the cost of each trip is $ 22. You can see the places where you can buy the card on the following map:
