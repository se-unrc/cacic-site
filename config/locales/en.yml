  cacic_history: The XXV Argentinean Conference of Computer Science is going to 
    take place for first time in Cordoba Province, during the second week of
    October, at headquarters of Facultad de Ciencias Exactas, Físico-Químicas y
    Naturales of Universidad Nacional de Río Cuarto, Río Cuarto, Córdoba,
    Argentina. CACIC is the national event with greatest participation and more
    federal reaching. It acts as a meeting point for researches, teaches,
    grade/postgrade students and IT practicioners.

  course2_detail: Detailed description of the course (in Spanish)
  course2_prerequisites1: 
    It's important for attendants to have sufficient knowledge on programming, 
    knowledge on programming, as this course is hands-on.
  course2_prerequisites2: 
    Acceptable languages are Smalltalk, Java, C#, Python, Ruby, JavaScript and PHP.
  course2_prerequisites3: 
    The software requirements for taking the course (this is for students' own computers) is simply 
    to have the programming language installed (with a suitable IDE), and a corresponding xUnit framework.
  course3_prerequisites: While it is recommended that attendants are already familiar with basic 
    concepts from probability theory and programming languages, this course 
    will go through all the necessary concepts. It is a self-content course that should 
    be accessible to any Computer Science student.
  course4_prerequisites: >
    Basic knowledge on discrete mathematics and propositional (boolean) logic.
  course2_description: The aim of this course is to convey the main concepts 
    of the software development technique known as  Test Driven Development (TDD), 
    through practical and everyday programming examples. This course starts with a brief 
    theoretical introduction, and then concentrates in practical programming exercises, 
    especially designed so that students can master the technique, as we believe that 
    'the best way to learn is by doing'
  course3_description1:  >
    In the last few years, probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) have 
    received increasing attenting, both from academia and industry. To a great extent, this is 
    due to the way in which these languages have revolutionized artificial intelligence. 
    For instance, modern PPLs can do in 50 lines of code what previously required over 1000.
  course3_description2:  >
    The main objective of this course is to introduce students to the "world" of PPLs, in a broad manner,
    covering both practical aspects and foundations. We will start by discussing the benefits and 
    potential of probabilistic computational models, going through their main applications, 
    putting special emphasis on the cause of this revolution: artificial intelligence and bayesian 
    reasoning. The second part of the course will cover the main challenges in the design and 
    implementation of PPLs. Finally, we will discuss the formal semantics and different 
    verification techniques for probabilistic programs.
  course4_description1:  >
    Propositional logic: definitions and limitations. 
  course4_description2:  >
    Predicate logic: definitions and limitations.
  course4_description3:  >
    Relational logic. 
  course4_description4:  >
    Program specification: weakest precondition, partial and total program correctness. 
  course4_description5:  >
    The Java Modeling Language: a language for program specification.  
  course4_description6:  >
    Automated fault localization. 
  course4_description7:  >
    Automated program repair.
